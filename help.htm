<h3>2. Measuring the movie's frame rate (FPS)</h3>
<p>If you have to change subtitles frame rate, you need to know your movie's
frame rate first. Load a movie into the player and press the [Measure] button.
Wait for about 20 seconds (by default) for the FPS to be measured. This feature
is not very precise yet. If you think that the FPS is not measured correctly,
try to increase the measuring interval from the Tools -&gt; Options dialog, or
set it manually.</p>
<h3>3. Changing the frame rate of the subtitle file</h3>
<p>If your subtitles are completely out of sync, the subtitle file might be
using a frame rate, different from the FPS of the movie. Measure or set manually
the movie's frame rate as described in point 2. Double-click on the either Start
or End column of any subtitle to retrieve the Recalculate frames dialog. Select
&quot;Change the FPS of the entire movie&quot; option and type or choose the new
frame rate. Press OK to have all the frames recalculated.</p>
<h3>4. Applying delays to the subtitles</h3>
<p>If your subtitles appear earlier or later, you may need to apply certain
delay in order to get them back in sync. Go to the first subtitle, from which on
the movie is out of sync (usually the very first subtitle). Double-click on its
Start frame value. Select the &quot;Add seconds&quot; radio box and type a delay
in seconds (may be a negative number if the subtitles appear later). Ensure that
the &quot;Recalculate the frames for the rest of the movie&quot; checkbox is
checked and press OK.</p>
<h3>5. Splitting subtitles</h3>
<p>If you have a 2-CD movie, you may wish to split the subtitles file in two.
Select the <i>last</i> title, which you wish to put in the first file, and
select Edit -&gt; Split subtitles... Type the names for the both files, press
the [Save files] button and select a destination folder on your disk.</p>
<h3>6. Merging subtitle files</h3>
<p>When you have 2 subtitle files and you wish to merge them into one, use
&quot;Append subtitles&quot; feature of Subtitler.&nbsp; If you have the first
file opened, select File -&gt; Append subtitle file...&nbsp; and point to the
second file to be merged with the one, which is already opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
merging position will be marked with yellow. If you have the second file opened,
you may wish to append it to the end of another file. Select File -&gt; Append
subtitles to... and point to the file, to which you wish to append the currently
opened file. A suffix &quot;-NEW&quot; will be added to the name of the merged
file.</p>
